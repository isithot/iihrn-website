We'd love to licence our stuff for commercial use, but we use observations from the [Bureau of Meteorology](http://www.bom.gov.au/catalogue/data-feeds.shtml) that are, in turn, not licensed to us for commercial use (yet!). But posting, tweeting or otherwise sharing our plots for non-commercial purposes makes up happy!

Info and sources of the data we use are summarised on [GitHub](https://github.com/isithot/isithotrightnow/blob/master/data/README.md).
